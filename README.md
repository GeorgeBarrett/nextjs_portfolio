## about

this a portfolio site that has dynamic routing and is fully responsive

## build

the build used react/next.js, tailwind, and react-icons

## improvements

need to deploy projects and add links to the demo button (this button is viewed when a user clicks on one of my projects)

the website is fully operational but there is an error message to do with unique keys. i will amend this

the project images are different sizes in the portfolio section. this needs to be corrected for style continuity

the page that displays individual projects needs some styling

## git

a solid foundation in git was used thoughout the project
